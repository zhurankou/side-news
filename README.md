## Web App

This application uses NewsAPI.org API to fetch news headline from chosen sources on the chosen topic and further provides UI to compare specific headline with another news source.

For instance, the user chooses CNN news source and inputs a query "Why it's taking so long for the government to reunite families" into the input field. The app then fetches the NewsAPI JSON file with the given headline and displays all current headlines with the provided input. After that, the user is being prompted to compare these headlines to a different news source and receives another search results for this topic from the chosen source.

The app's search functionality provided by [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org)
